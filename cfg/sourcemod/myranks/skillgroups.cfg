// Add ranks in order here, from smallest at the top, to biggest at the end.
// The % is from 0.0 to 1.0, how many points of the Top score a player has that is needed to get that rank.
// So if Bill is ranked 1 with 100 score, and PRO rank is 0.95, then everyone with 95 or more score is PRO.
// It will always default to the first element if there is not enough score for others, so I would keep that on 0.
